I think I had the right aproach regarding planning in the beginning. 
At least for me it was good to get all the structure and easier parts
out of the way, before starting on the more difficult sparts like the database. 
It gave me better overview and I was able to work out some of my doubts about hooks before starting on the database.
I tried to submit to github regularly after each section. Altough that got a little messy later on. 

however, sometimes I had an idea on how to fix a minor issue or some othe minor things.
Therefor the commits became less structured ass I worked on several section at the same time. 
Also, last night I spend a lot of time working out minor issues instead of focussing on getting points.
That wasn't as efficient as it could have been. 

Lastly, I think I need more practice on the dynamic routing.
That was the biggest challenge in this project by far for me.
I lost a lot of time working out the routing issues and I feel like that should improve. 
Also, the sorting the names part took me some time to get right.
Turns out I need to pay more attention to data types and syntax.
Overall, I enjoyed the challange and I am looking forward to the next one.
